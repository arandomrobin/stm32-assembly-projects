# STM32 Assembly Projects – Embedded Systems Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of bare-metal ARM assembly projects developed on the STM32F407VG microcontroller using STM32CubeIDE.

## Overview
- Platform: STM32F407VG (ARM Cortex-M4)
- Language: ARM Assembly
- Development: STM32CubeIDE
- Focus: Register-level programming, hardware control, and embedded system fundamentals

## Projects
### GPIO LED Control
Implemented direct register-level control of GPIO peripherals to configure output pins and toggle LEDs without HAL abstraction.

### Timer & Interrupt Handling
Configured hardware timers and interrupt vectors in assembly to generate periodic events and handle ISR execution.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Bare-metal embedded programming
- ARM Cortex-M architecture
- GPIO, timers, and interrupt handling
- Debugging and testing in STM32CubeIDE
